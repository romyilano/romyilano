- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @romyilano, a passionate artist and engineer
- The Swift community is awesome and I often help support the local [SF Bay Area SLUG/CocoaHeads meetup](https://www.meetup.com/swift-language/)
- I love the SudoRoom hackerspace and Oakland https://www.sudoroom.org - the SF Bay Area is unique & will never be duplicated in the world
- Meeting people in-person in a walkable city always is > online meetups
- ðŸ‘€ I'm interested in both building things and the process of building things and am rebuilding my personal blog https://www.romyilano.com/blog
- **Caveat** I'm not a big javascript or web design person and the JS code on here is for prototyping :P so not all of it is clean
